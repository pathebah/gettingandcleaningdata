added files in the git directory are:

run_analysis.R
This contrains the R script to tidy the data as follows:

1 - Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2 - Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
3 - Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4 - Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
5 - From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

finalDataSet.R
This is the final data set produced by the script in setp 5 above.
